# Blockchain for social good
For the longest time, innovation has led to prosperity for the selected few. 

Technical Innovation (E.g., Blockchain) must not only benefit and prosper the selected few in society. Technical Innovation should benefit the masses in  ways which are tangible -- Think: How does a life of a common man on the street who is not in the tech industry can benefit from the blockchain revolution? 

The very nature of blockchain -- decentralisation -- dictates that the benefits (monetary and/or other forms) should be diffused/enjoyed among the masses and not be limited to the selected few.

This paper stands at that crossroad. It explores how blockchain can be leverage to benefit masses.
